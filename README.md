# Melbourne-real-time-fMRI-Neurofeedback
This repository contains resources and template scripts to guide learning and implementation of real-time fMRI neurofeedback experiments.
This requires MATLAB and Psychtoolbox, and all the sample data can be found inside the Data folder (requires unzipping).
The sample data has been obtained from trial runs with Turbo BrainVoyager.

Refer to the PDF materials provided for more instructions.
